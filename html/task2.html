	<h1>BURGER</h1>
	<p> Sink your teeth into a delicious restaurant-style, hamburger recipe. 
		I like the hamburgers most because hamburger is a blank canvas for whatever you want to create. 
		You can even make a vegetarian version if that works better with your diet.  
		Type of protein, variety of toppings, different types of buns.  
		It really is up to the chef to create exactly what he or she wants at the time. </p>

	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
